TreeRotator -
LinkedBinaryTree.java is an implementation of a binary tree. Note that the rotate() method takes in a Position and rotates it with its parent. Two binary search trees on the same set of keys can be transformed into each other via a sequence of tree rotations. In the file TreeRotator.java, implemented the printRotations() method, which prints out a sequence of keys corresponding to the nodes one needs to rotate to get from the first tree to the second.
