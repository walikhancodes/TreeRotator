TreeRotator -
In LinkedBinaryTree.java you are already given an implementation of a binary tree. Note that the rotate( ) method takes in a Position and rotates it with its parent. Two binary search trees on the same set of keys can be transformed into each other via a sequence of tree rotations. In the file TreeRotator.java, implement the printRotations( ) method, which prints out a sequence of keys corresponding to the nodes one needs to rotate to get from the first tree to the second

TreeSet, SelfBalancingTree, & TreeSorter - 
Edit TreeSet.java so that it implements the PriorityQueue interface. Then, adapt any of the textbook's self-balancing binary search trees (AVL, splay, red-black) in Self-BalancingTreeSet.java. Finally, code up the two approaches for extracting elements in TreeSorter.java (an inOrder( ) method is already implemented in TreeSet.java). In the same file, write a tester method that compares the four approaches on a large randomly shuffleed list (e.g., of 2,000,000 elements).
